Self-Driving Car with JavaScript - Neural Networks and Machine Learning topic likely explores the implementation of neural networks and machine learning techniques to simulate self-driving car behavior using JavaScript. This involves training a neural network to make decisions based on sensor inputs, enabling the car to navigate and react autonomously within a simulated environment.
